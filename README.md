# FARMER_MILKRECORD
Task 1:This task involves developing a program to facilitate the recording of milk yields for each cow in a dairy herd over the course of a week. The program should prompt users to enter the unique identity code of each cow and the corresponding milk yield every time the cow is milked. The recorded data will be used for subsequent analysis of herd performance.
Task 2: In this task, you will implement functionality to calculate essential statistics for the dairy herd based on the recorded milk yield data. This includes computing the total weekly volume of milk produced by the entire herd and determining the average yield per cow for the week. The calculated statistics will provide valuable insights into overall herd productivity.
Task 3 focuses on analyzing the recorded milk yield data to identify productivity trends and potential areas for improvement in herd management. The program should identify the cow that has produced the most milk during the week, as well as any cows that consistently produce less than 12 liters of milk on four or more days. This analysis will empower dairy farmers to make informed decisions to optimize herd performance and enhance productivity.
